# Freewayser-Starter-Pack

What is Freeways?
==================

Freeways is an Open Source and Free Software Club in the Higher Institute of Computer Science (“Institut Supérieur d’Informatique“).
Our club was founded in January of 2004 and since then it has worked tirelessly to reunite and engage all of the students that are fascinated with the concept of free software and all new technologies.
Freeways started off as a simple club, but thanks to the efforts of all Freeways members across multiple Universities, it became an Association in 2014.

What’s Free Software?
======================

The concept of “Free software” is tightly linked to the notion of respecting users' freedom and one’s community.
More accurately, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.
We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French term to show we do not mean the software is gratis but that the liberty associated to free software goes beyond its price only.

 What does Open Source mean?
 ============================
 
Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. On the contrary, a closed source software cannot be reviewed by anyone, meaning that there is no chance to even verify its security or to improve it.
“I think it’s essential for a program of this nature to be open source” - Satoshi  Nakamoto ….

Our Objectives
===============

The main focuses of our club as of now:
* Diffuse the culture of free software and the concept of sharing the knowledge.
* Sensitize students about the importance of free software.
* Acquire a very hard training to acquire and develop new skills.
* Reunite people who have the same interest in working in groups and sharing.
