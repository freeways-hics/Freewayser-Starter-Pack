# Freewayser-Starter-Pack

What is Freeways?
==================

Freeways is an Open Source and Free Software Club in the Higher Institute of Computer Science (“Institut Supérieur d’Informatique“).
Our club was founded in January of 2004 and since then it has worked tirelessly to reunite and engage all of the students that are fascinated with the concept of free software and all new technologies.
Freeways started off as a simple club, but thanks to the efforts of all Freeways members across multiple Universities, it became an Association in 2014.

What’s Free Software?
======================

The concept of “Free software” is tightly linked to the notion of respecting users' freedom and one’s community.
More accurately, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.
We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French term to show we do not mean the software is gratis but that the liberty associated to free software goes beyond its price only.

 What does Open Source mean?
 ============================
 
Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. On the contrary, a closed source software cannot be reviewed by anyone, meaning that there is no chance to even verify its security or to improve it.
“I think it’s essential for a program of this nature to be open source” - Satoshi  Nakamoto ….

Our Objectives
===============

The main focuses of our club as of now:
* Diffuse the culture of free software and the concept of sharing the knowledge.
* Sensitize students about the importance of free software.
* Acquire a very hard training to acquire and develop new skills.
* Reunite people who have the same interest in working in groups and sharing.

Our Activities
==============

At Freeways, we have 3 departments, each of which has a skilled manager, a specific schedule and goals to reach.

## High Level Programming Department

In this department, we mainly focus on web development, mobile development (i.e.: Android) and gaming. We provide to students a very high quality training to improve themselves as well as help beginners in this field to start progressively understanding and learning how to program.

## Problem Solving
Problem solving is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem so they can be able to translate it to a code that is understandable by a machine.
To do that we work with our most competent students, who are not only able to brainstorm solutions to different problems, but are also very hard workers and solve at least few of an array of problems every week.
At freeways we provide training sessions and mini-competitions for competitive programming to prepare our students for the CPC (Computer Programming Competition).

## Robotic Department

Robotics deal with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as specialized computer systems to control the robots.
Nowadays, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various
practical purposes. That’s why at Freeways we are pursuing this technology.
This departments’ activities involve the planning of regular workshops that introduce our students to robotics and help them to improve and put to practice their skills in this section.
